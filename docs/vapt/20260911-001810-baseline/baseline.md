## Alert Detail



### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

* URL: http://host.docker.internal:5173
  * Node Name: `http://host.docker.internal:5173`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://host.docker.internal:5173/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://host.docker.internal:5173/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 2

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### [ Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90003/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

The integrity attribute is missing on a script or link tag served by an external server. The integrity tag prevents an attacker who have gained access to this server from injecting a malicious content.

  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

Provide a valid integrity attribute to the tag.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://host.docker.internal:5173
  * Node Name: `http://host.docker.internal:5173`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`

Instances: Systemic


### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10027/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response appears to contain suspicious comments which may help an attacker.

* URL: http://host.docker.internal:5173/@vite/client
  * Node Name: `http://host.docker.internal:5173/@vite/client`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ` `\0`, a convention from the rollup ecosyste`
  * Other Info: `The following pattern was used: \bFROM\b and was detected in likely comment: "/**
* Plugins that use 'virtual modules' (e.g. for helper functions), prefix the
* module ID with `\0`, a convention from the ro", see evidence field for the suspicious comment/snippet.`


Instances: 1

### Solution

Remove all comments that return information that may help an attacker and fix any underlying problems they refer to.

### [ Modern Web Application ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10109/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The application appears to be a modern web application. If you need to explore it automatically then the Client Spider may well be more effective than the standard one.
